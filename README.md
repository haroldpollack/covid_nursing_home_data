# covid_nursing_home_data
This is a simple program to read web-available COVID nursing home data 
It provides a simple R program that reads data from 
https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-COVID-19-Nursing-Home/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Dataset/s2uc-8wxp/data,
and it provides sample output.
Note that I uploaded two R programs. One directly reads from the API.
These are not the world's greatest programs, but 
I thought folk would find this useful to track what is happening.

NOTE NOTE NOTE: These data have many complexities and limitations. This article by Mcgarry, Grabowski, and Barnett lists some of them: 
"Severe Staffing And Personal Protective Equipment Shortages Faced By Nursing Homes During The COVID-19 Pandemic." Also see the links to related articles below it.
